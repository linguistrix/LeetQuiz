# LeetQuiz

Quickly put-together code for the LeetCode themed quiz I conducted for Bay Area Quiz Club. Can be accessed at https://www.antarikshbothale.com/baqc-feb-2024/.

# Details

Everything is purely client-side. The page was saved from the actual LeetCode page and stripped off of other stuff, so note that many things like sorting etc. don't work.

Just dump the folder anywhere and you should be able to view the website by opening `index.html`.
The question names and difficulty has been hard-coded in `script.js`. 

The `slides` folder contains all the images representing the questions and answers. Note that there are two images per quiz question, one for the question and one for the answer. The current numbering just runs from 1 to 2N where N is the number of questions. You can tweak the code to put the questions in `script.js` directly instead of using images.
